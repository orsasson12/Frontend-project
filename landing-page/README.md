Hello everyone 😁, I have made this landing page for me to learn. I started to think what is better for me 🤔 tailwind ? Or Material Ui. Both are great libraries that provide a lot of templates that can help us make a "clean" designHowever, they do not work the same way. Tailwind uses classes that come with ready-made designs. And materials use components that we can add to our code. 

For the animation, I used the AOSLibrary, and for the smooth scroll, I used react-scroll

I will upload the other landing page with material UI once I have finished learning and making the website. I hope you will enjoy this website.
