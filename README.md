A comparison of two frontend style tools


After I finished making both the tailwind and material user interface projects. In order to compare them, I made almost the same project with another tool. I want to compare them. Unless you upload code, there is no better way to do that, so I'll put a few images that illustrate the differences between them. If someone can help me to understand better, I'd love to hear from you. I look forward to your enjoyment üòÅ.

As you can see in the About component, I have created two files, one to store the React Component and the other hold the styles. All I have to do is import them and use them inside the component. That's better, in my opinion, because the main component won't look cluttered. Down there you can find almost the same result. However, with Tailwind I have made only 1 file that holds the style and the data. As you can see you have to use a lot of classes to make a simple thing

At the end I did that just for myself. I wanted to see what would be best for me to work with. If you haven't found the right tool for you yet, I recommend you do the same. For you.
